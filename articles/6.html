<p><a href="https://markdoc.io/docs/faq#why-not-mdx">Why not MDX?</a>
<a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> is a Markdown variant that allows users to embed content written in JavaScript and React's JSX templating syntax. Like Markdoc, MDX makes it possible to incorporate React components into a piece of documentation. The key difference is that MDX supports arbitrarily-complex JavaScript logic (think: docs as code) while Markdoc enforces a strict separation between code and content (think: docs as data).</p>
<p>Markdoc uses a fully declarative approach to composition and flow control, where MDX relies on JavaScript and React. This means MDX affords users more power and flexibility, but at the cost of complexity–content can quickly become as complex as regular code, which can lead to maintainability complications or a more difficult authoring environment.</p>
<p>One of the key motivations for creating Markdoc at Stripe was to create a format that is optimized for writing rather than programming so that we could overcome the challenges that resulted from mixing code and content in our legacy documentation platform. With Markdoc, contributors can iterate quickly without having to subject their edits to a code review and the standard of technical scrutiny that we would have to apply to a format that supports embedded JavaScript. Markdoc also helps us enforce stronger controls around presentation and page logic, avoiding situations in which one-off hacks and procedural content generation introduce bugs and unpredictable behavior.</p>
<p>Markdoc's first-class, declarative tag syntax integrates seamlessly with Markdown content and can make it simpler to handle content transforms, static analysis, and validation in a unified, lightweight manner. In MDX, some of these tasks require operating on a more complicated JavaScript AST and accounting for the full spectrum of JavaScript language features. MDX also has a significantly larger runtime dependency footprint and relies on a JavaScript parser to handle the embedded logic.</p>
<p><a href="https://markdoc.io/docs/faq#why-not-asciidoc">Why not AsciiDoc?</a>
<a href="https://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a> is a plain-text markup format that is designed specifically for technical writing, incorporating ideas from DocBook and other publishing technologies. AsciiDoc gets a lot of things right–extensibility, support for highly-structured content, parsing to an AST, and open governance.</p>
<p>We are big fans of AsciiDoc–it was a major source of inspiration when we began designing Markdoc. In fact, our earliest efforts to modernize our content format at Stripe back in 2017 involved a proof-of-concept built on the Ruby-based <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">AsciiDoctor</a> library. There are several reasons why we ultimately moved to Markdown instead of proceeding with AsciiDoc as our efforts progressed.</p>
<p>AsciiDoc is less ubiquitous than Markdown, which means it is less familiar to engineers and technical writers. AsciiDoc has a number of syntactic idiosyncrasies that create friction for adopters, making it a tough sell to users who already know and want Markdown. For example, AsciiDoc requires the use of <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/unordered/#nested-unordered-list">multiple leading asterisks</a> in order to express nested bulleted lists because the format is designed to not treat whitespace as significant. And in order to nest delimited content blocks, it relies on <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/delimited/#nesting">varying the length</a> of the delimiter line–unintutive and error-prone syntax.</p>
<p>AsciiDoc's extensibility model would have allowed us to repurpose some of the format's built-in patterns to do many of the same things we do in Markdoc, but at the cost of usability, because AsciiDoc ultimately wasn't designed with our requirements and use case in mind. Markdown paired Markdoc's syntactic extensions result in an overall smaller surface area than AsciiDoc's feature set, which means less complexity and easier adoption.</p>
